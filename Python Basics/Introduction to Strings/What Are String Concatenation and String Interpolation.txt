When working with strings, combining different pieces of text together is a common operation you'll often find yourself dealing with.

In Python, you can combine multiple strings together with the plus (+) operator. This process is called string concatenation. Here's how to concatenate two strings with the plus operator:

my_str_1 = 'Hello'
my_str_2 = "World"

str_plus_str = my_str_1 + ' ' + my_str_2
print(str_plus_str) # Hello World
But note that this only works with strings. If you try to concatenate a string with a number, you'll get a TypeError:

name = 'John Doe'
age = 26

name_and_age = name + age
print(name_and_age) # TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
This happens because Python does not automatically convert other data types like integers into strings when you concatenate them. Python requires all elements to be strings before it can concatenate them. To fix that, you can convert the number into a string with the built-in str() function, which returns the string representation of the given object without modifying the original object:

name = 'John Doe'
age = 26

name_and_age = name + str(age)
print(name_and_age) # John Doe26
You can also use the augmented assignment operator for concatenation. This is represented by a plus and equals sign (+=), and performs both concatenation and assignment in one step. Here's it in action:

name = 'John Doe'
age = 26

name_and_age = name  # Start with the name
name_and_age += str(age)  # Append the age as string

print(name_and_age)  # John Doe26
The process of inserting variables and expressions into a string is called string interpolation. Python has a category of string called f-strings (short for formatted string literals), which allows you to handle interpolation with a compact and readable syntax.

F-strings start with f (either lowercase or uppercase) before the quotes, and allow you to embed variables or expressions inside replacement fields indicated by curly braces ({}). Here's an example:

name = 'John Doe'
age = 26
name_and_age = f'My name is {name} and I am {age} years old'
print(name_and_age) # My name is John Doe and I am 26 years old

num1 = 5
num2 = 10
print(f'The sum of {num1} and {num2} is {num1 + num2}') # The sum of 5 and 10 is 15
Note how you don't need to convert non-string types with the str() function. In the example above, the value of the age, num1, and num2 variables is converted under the hood into a string during the interpolation process.
